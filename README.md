NeuroStemVolt is a user-friendly analysis tool with a graphical interface for processing fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) data from iPSC-derived neuronal spheroids. 
It enables in-depth analysis of spontaneous neurotransmitter release, neuronal excitability, transporter kinetics, and drug response dynamics over time.

Whether you're characterizing iPSC-derived neuronal systems or investigating neurotransmission under pharmacological conditions, NeuroStemVolt offers streamlined and flexible analysis workflows that can be adapted to a wide range of experimental setups in modern neurophysiological research.

Key Features:

Data Pre-processing
Interactive color plots and Current-vs-time traces
Multiple filtering options (e.g., smoothing, baseline correction)
Visualization of raw vs. filtered data

Spontaneous Activity Detection
Detection and quantification of spontaneous neurotransmitter release events via peak detection algorithms

Neuronal Excitability Analysis
Analysis of stimulus-evoked release amplitudes to assess neuronal responsiveness

Transporter Kinetics Evaluation
